        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falafel">Falafel</a>
            (/fəˈlɑːfəl/; Arabic: فلافل‎, [fæˈlæːfɪl] (listen); Hebrew: פלאפל‎) is a deep-fried ball or patty-shaped fritter made from ground chickpeas, broad beans, or both.
            Falafel is a traditional Middle Eastern food, commonly served in a pita, which acts as a pocket, or wrapped in a flatbread known as taboon; "falafel" also frequently refers to a wrapped sandwich that is prepared in this way.
            The falafel balls are topped with salads, pickled vegetables, hot sauce, and drizzled with tahini-based sauces.
            Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a snack or served as part of a meze tray (assortment of appetizers).
        </p>
        <p>
            An easy, yummy way to make falafel. Serve with pita bread and your favorite tzatziki.
